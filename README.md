- [ ] Movement occurs on a sort of a grid
- [ ] Nearby towns and villages on adjacent blocks provide support for recruting armies and obtaining supplies
- [ ] Armies are spawned on either adjacent blocks or on the same block
- [ ] Player needs to manage their resources such that they can reach the given destination without dying
