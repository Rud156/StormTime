# StormTime
> A Simple Top Down 2D Game

## Theme And Limitations:
- Theme -> Storm
- Limitation -> 2D and Top Down Camera

## Idea:
- [ ] Storm theme: "If I kill anyone, may lighting strike me"
- [ ] Neon based bullet hell world
- [ ] Multiple weapon types useful depending on the situation
- [ ] All not unlocked at once. Points earned in the game can be used to unlock them
- [ ] Simple shapes the main characters
- [ ] Player goes around talking to people in the world
- [ ] Interactions initially start with dialogues
- [ ] This progresses to more dialogues or combat depending on what the player choses
- [ ] Each kill takes away a point of some sort
- [ ] So, the player must make correct decisions between killing and helping
- [ ] When points hit zero, a sort of boss encounter occurs
- [ ] Boss encounter occurs in a new world which is a desolated and nasty world with bad weather effects
- [ ] Upon winning the fight player gets to live till the next encounter and the process repeats
- [ ] Infinite single level world
- [ ] Player needs to move around it to encounter other groups and NPC(s)
- [ ] Just standing idle without any encounter will result in a lighting shot dealing damage

## Later Ideas:
- [ ] Player can acquire new gang members by talking to them and thus not killing them
- [ ] They get added to the player's party depending on the player's previous actions
