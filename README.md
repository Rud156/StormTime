# StormTime
> A simple turn based strategy game

## Theme And Limitations:
- Theme -> Storm
- Limitation -> 2D and Top Down Camera

## Ideas:
- [ ] Turn based movement for the player
- [ ] In the stormy nights attacks occur
- [ ] The player must use their available armies and defenses to guard till they reach their destination
- [ ] Movement occurs on a sort of a grid
- [ ] Nearby towns and villages on adjacent blocks provide support for recruting armies and obtaining supplies
- [ ] Armies are spawned on either adjacent blocks or on the same block
- [ ] Player needs to manage their resources such that they can reach the given destination without dying
- [ ] A pixelated neon world.
- [ ] Scrolling map with the camera focused on the player
- [ ] Randomly generated maps based on various parameters
- [ ] Each grid tile has randomly generated events. Most of them are interactable
- [ ] Events are text-based. Basically, when the player reaches the point, the event pops up and they get to do something
- [ ] Some sort of points can be earned from each encounter. Points can also be lost if you do something incorrect These help to buy stuff and also move to other tiles
- [ ] If the player runs out of points or dies, the level resets
- [ ] There will also be traveling enemies. Th remember whether they encountered the player or not and whether they got defeated
