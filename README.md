# StormTime
> A Simple Top Down 2D Game

## Theme And Limitations:
- Theme -> Storm
- Limitation -> 2D and Top Down Camera

## Idea:
- [X] Neon based bullet hell world
- [ ] Multiple weapon types useful depending on the situation
- [ ] All not unlocked at once. Enemy drops give weapons
- [X] Simple shapes the main characters
- [ ] Boss encounter occurs in a new world which is a desolated and nasty world with bad weather effects
- [X] Player needs to move around it to encounter other groups and NPC(s)
- [ ] Allow multiple shots per soul (Give more bullets)

## Later Ideas:
- [ ] Player can acquire new gang members by talking to them and thus not killing them
- [ ] They get added to the player's party depending on the player's previous actions
