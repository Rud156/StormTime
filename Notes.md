### Gameplay Changes

- [X] Wheel Enemy is to be kept as is. Albeit with a bit of speed reduction. The danger level needs to be changed for this (increased). As the enemy is really hard to avoid if multiple starts shooting. Also, it reduces frame rate considering the sheer number of particle systems being played at the same time.
- [X] Slasher Enemy needs to be kept. Speed needs to be reduced so that the player can actually dodge it. Else, it can be made so that it catches up with the player and then starts moving slowly  when it is nearby to give the player a bit of breathing room.
- [X] Spinner Enemy and Burst Enemy needs to be removed. Both of them are pretty similar to the Wheel Enemy and also they do not offer as much challenge. Instead 2 more different types of enemy must come into being.
- [X] Laser Enemy. This is a new type of enemy. It targets the player and shoot a laser beam directed at them. This is will make it difficult for the player to avoid if there are multiple of them as they kind of block paths that the player can use to easily move. Has a slightly low danger value as the lasers can be avoided easily.
- [X] Bomb Enemy. This is also a new type of enemy that shoots short range bullets towards the player that causes a ring damage. The player must understand the range and stay away from it. The danger value should be on the same level as Wheel Enemy as it can become difficult when there are multiple of them in a certain range.
- [X] The player needs a kind of shield when they exit a shop or player modifier as the number of bullet that are being shot, does not give them a breathing room.
- [X] A secondary purpose of souls is a temporary player shield. It makes the player invulnerable for a short amount of time. It consumes a certain number of souls. Also it can be modified by using player modifier.
- [ ] The frequency of shops must increase so that it allows the player to replenish their health as and when required.

### Things that must exist

- [ ] GamePad support is mandatory as it improves the gameplay.
- [ ] The Portal requires a certain number of souls to enter. This must be conveyed to the player before hand so that they don't end up spending every souls that they have.
- [ ] Tweak the amount of damage that the player takes when they have less souls. This must balance out the damage that the player gives to the enemies. Such that even if souls are less, the player can actually kill an enemy within the time and pickup their souls within the time they die.
- [ ] Make a Start, Basic Story and a Game Over screen to complete the flow.
